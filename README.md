# flatfire pre-release backtest module

Backtester is designed to provide an automated, data-driven framework for validating the historical performance of the "Pointland entry / Sphere exit" trading strategy, enabling informed decisions before committing real capital. This pre-release Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the SignalBacktester offers significant value by transforming raw historical market data into actionable insights.

## Key Value Drivers:
## Strategic De-Risking & Confidence Building:
# What it does: Simulates trades based on the defined strategy (pointland_signal for entry, sphere_exit for exit logic) using historical market data (_fetch_data, _validate_and_clean_data) over a user-specified period (start_date, end_date).
# Value Delivered:
# Answers the critical question: "How might this specific strategy have performed in the past?"
Allows for testing and refinement of strategy parameters (square_threshold, distance_threshold) in a risk-free environment.
Builds confidence in a strategy's potential before live deployment, significantly reducing the risk of capital loss from untested ideas.
# Quantitative & Objective Performance Measurement:
#What it does: For each simulated trade, it meticulously calculates key performance indicators encapsulated in the ExitResult (e.g., success, failure, profit, exit_price, exit_time).
#Value Delivered:

Moves beyond subjective assessments to provide concrete, data-backed evidence of strategy performance.
Enables objective comparison between different parameter sets or minor strategy variations (once future iterations allow).


Provides clear metrics to evaluate whether a strategy meets predefined performance benchmarks.

# Deeper Understanding of Strategy Dynamics & Risk Profile:

#W hat it does:
Calculates dynamic target and stop levels based on market conditions at the time of the signal (_calculate_target_and_stop using signal_high, signal_low, and distance_threshold).
Evaluates multiple exit conditions: hitting profit targets, stop-loss levels, or encountering opposing signals (_check_exit_conditions, _determine_exit_outcome).
Introduces a unique risk metric: time_above_stop, quantifying how long a trade remained favorable relative to its stop-loss level.
# Value Delivered:
Offers insights into how and why trades exit, revealing patterns in strategy behavior.
Helps identify potential weaknesses, such as premature exits or vulnerability to specific market conditions.
The time_above_stop metric provides a nuanced view of a trade's resilience and the proximity to risk, which is often missed in simple win/loss analysis.
Automation & Operational Efficiency:
#What it does: Automates the entire backtesting workflow: data retrieval (via PostgresDAO), data cleaning and validation, signal generation (implicitly, as it uses them), trade simulation, and results calculation.

# Value Delivered:
Drastically reduces the time and manual effort required for backtesting compared to spreadsheet-based or manual chart analysis.
Ensures consistency and repeatability in testing, eliminating human error.
Frees up valuable analyst/trader time for strategy development and interpretation of results, rather than laborious data processing.
Solid Foundation for Future Expansion (MVP Value):
#What it does: Establishes a functional codebase with key architectural components: a dedicated SignalBacktester class, interaction with data access objects (PostgresDAO, BacktestDAO), clearly defined data structures (ExitResult), and configurable parameters.
# Value Delivered:
Serves as a proven proof-of-concept for the core backtesting logic.
Provides a robust and modular foundation upon which more advanced features can be built efficiently (e.g., support for multiple strategies, portfolio-level backtesting, advanced analytics, risk modeling, parameter optimization suites, visualization tools).
Accelerates the development lifecycle for a more comprehensive trading analytics platform.
Target Audience & Communication Focus:
Traders & Quantitative Analysts: Emphasize de-risking, objective performance metrics, deep strategy insights (especially time_above_stop), and the ability to test ideas rapidly.
# Development Team: Highlight the clean architecture, automation capabilities, and the solid foundation for future feature development.
# Management & Stakeholders: Focus on risk reduction, data-driven decision-making, operational efficiency, and the strategic value of building proprietary analytics tools.

visualization.py, a new module with utilities for creating interactive Plotly charts that display portfolio values and trade signals from backtest data. The implementation handles edge cases like empty data, includes proper error logging, and ensures correct data processing for visualization purposes.
